<h3>We can offer advice about heritage or ecologically sensitive landscapes</h3>

<p>We have considerable experience in the restoration of heritage and historical landscapes and have made successful multi-million pound applications to the Heritage Lottery Fund to carry out restoration of many of Britain's heritage parks. We have expertise in undertaking historical research using old maps and documents to evaluate a landscape's historical significance.</p>

<h3>We are experts at community design and local landscaping</h3>

<p>We work with communities on projects whose success is founded on the involvement of local people, giving a sense of ownership and belonging. We can investigate and prepare grant applications aimed at funding organisations, and consult with the community on design options via leaflets, open events and information sessions with children and residents. We work together with local people to carry out work on the ground, such as planting hedges, clearing vegetation and maintenance of facilities once complete.
