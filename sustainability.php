<p> LandShape believes that sustainability should be paramount to landscape design, informing and shaping designs of all scales and 
situations, from rural national parks to inner city gardens.</p>

<p>LandShape promotes all aspects of sustainability within landscape design and construction, from simple measures such as the 
provision of green and living roofs in garden structures to large scale ecological improvements.  LandShape works with ecologists and 
arboriculturalists to provide design solutions which respond best to the natural environment in which they sit.</p>
